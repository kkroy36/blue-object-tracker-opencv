Blue-object-tracker-opencv (Python)
===================================

This script accesses the webcam and converts the captured frame from BGR to HSV and the HSV threshold is adjusted such that only blue objects are shown on the screen.

This script can also be used to detect other colored objects. All that has to be done is to just change the HSV threshold ie change the hue-saturation-value according to the color one wants to track.
